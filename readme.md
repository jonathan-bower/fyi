Find Your VC.

Find Your VC (formerly Find Your Investor - hence FYI repo) is a data product that helps guide entrepreneurs and founders to find the right investors more efficiently so that they can spend more time focusing on their business.  It is a collaborative filter built on the historic investments of venture capitlists.  This tool was built ontop of CrunchBase data. The back end used Python with the help of numpy, scipy, sci-kit learn and many others.  For web development it used a Flask framework, Docker - for the build, OrchardUp for hosting, some UX/UI help from twitter-typeahead and Bootstrap 3.0 grayscale CSS.

Until I decide if there is a business opportunity to use this app the code is unfortunately not open sourced.  If you are interested in exploring an opporunity don't hestitate to reach out.
