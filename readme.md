Find Your Investor.

Find Your Investor is a data product that helps guide entrepreneurs and founders to find the right investors more efficiently so that they can spend more time focusing on their business.  It is a collaborative filter built on the historic investments of venture capitlists.  This web-app was created from CrunchBase data using many tools. The back end was built in Python with the help of numpy, scipy, and sci-kit learn libraries to name a few.  For web development it used Flask framework, Docker - for the build, OrchardUp for hosting, some UX/UI help from twitter-typeahead and Bootstrap 3.0 grayscale CSS.

Until I decide if there is a business opportunity to use this app the code is unfortunately not open sourced.  If you are interested in exploring an opporunity don't hestitate to reach out.  In the meantime you can go check out my blog Noisy Signals @ http://jori-mobo.tumblr.com there should be a post about findyourvc.co up shortly if when you read this it isn't already up.
